# 03 • Autonomous Agents in Production (GenAI Agents)

Autonomous agents represent the next step in GenAI systems:
not only responding, but **acting**, **deciding**, and **orchestrating tools**.

This module treats agents as **distributed systems**, not features.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Design and operate **reliable, observable and secure GenAI agents** in production.

---

## 🧠 What a Real Production Agent Is

A production agent requires:
- Planning
- Memory
- Action control
- Security policies
- Observability
- Cost limits
